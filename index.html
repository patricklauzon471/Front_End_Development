        <h3>Teamwork and Communication</h3>
        <p class="P1">Through my participation in extracurricular activities, such as high school student council, The Listening Party, and Enactus,
          and my experience in the workforce in customer service oriented positions and technical engineering co-ops, I've found success
          through effectively communicating within different levels of an organization, whether that be in  a leadership role, like serving
          as studnet council prime minister, or just starting in a new field. I've been a good teammate and coworker because of my enthusiasm
        to learn and participate.</p>

        <h3>Project Building</h3>
        <p class="P1">While my coursework in school has given me a strong foundation, especially in the areas of mathematics, problem solving, and critical thinking,
          I want to take my learning beyond this and apply these tools to areas I'm passionate about. My first major Project
          123 Workouts, provides short instructional exercise content on Youtube, and other resources in the form of an interactive app, Excel Sheet, and Powerpoint
          . These resources make it quick, easy, and convenient to learn how to exercise and build upon previous your experience to take your workouts
        to the next level. There are other projects I've started on that deal with housing affordability and environmental concerns, but I need
      to build more skill and experience with coding to execute them, which led me to learning software development.</p>
